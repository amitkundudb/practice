### Spark Practice Repository
### Welcome, I'm Amit Kundu! ðŸš€

Welcome to my Spark practice repository! Having delved deep into Spark, I've compiled a comprehensive collection of topics and functions to streamline our learning journey. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

#### RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
- **How to create RDD**: Learn the fundamental steps to create RDDs, the basic building blocks of Spark.
- **RDD Transformations & Actions**: Explore various transformations like map(), filter(), and actions like collect() and count().

#### Dataframe
- **SparkSession**: Understand the entry point for Spark functionality and DataFrame creation.
- **Schema**: Discover how to define and work with schemas, providing structure to your data.
- **DataFrame Functions**: Dive into a plethora of functions like select(), filter(), and describe() for DataFrame manipulation.

#### RDD, Dataframe, Dataset [Difference and Converting from one to Another]
- **Understand the nuances and differences** between RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets, and learn to seamlessly convert between them.

#### Narrow and Wide Transformation
- **Learn about the types of transformations** in Spark - Narrow and Wide, and how they affect data processing.

#### File Formats with Schema
- **Reading Different File Formats with Schema**: Gain insights into reading CSV, JSON, and Parquet files with custom schemas, understanding the importance of options.

#### Handling Data
- **How to Handle NULL Values**: Explore methods like na.drop() and fillna() to manage null values effectively.
- **How to Handle Duplicates**: Understand the implications of duplicate data and learn techniques like distinct() and dropDuplicates().

#### Numeric and String Functions
- **Numeric Functions**: Perform mathematical operations like sum(), avg(), and round().
- **String Functions**: Manipulate strings using functions like upper(), trim(), and substring().

#### Date and Time Functions
- **Perform operations** on date and time data, such as current_date(), datediff(), and date_format().

#### Aggregate Functions and Joins
- **Aggregate Functions**: Compute aggregate values like mean, countDistinct, and collect_list.
- **Joins**: Master different types of joins like inner join, outer join, and self join.

#### Union and Window Functions
- **Union**: Combine datasets using union() and unionAll().
- **Window Functions**: Perform analytics operations within a window of data using functions like ROW_NUMBER and LEAD.

#### Array Functions and UDFs
- **Array Functions**: Handle arrays with functions like ARRAY_CONTAINS and ARRAY_LENGTH.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Extend Spark's functionality with custom functions.

#### Explode Array and Maps
- **Explore functions like explode() and posexplode()** to work with nested data structures efficiently.

#### Additional Functions
- **Explore from_json() and to_json()** for JSON data manipulation.
